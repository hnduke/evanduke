                <p>Dr. Evan Duke (D.M.A., M. Mus., and B. Mus.) has performed on trumpet, cornet, and French Horn. His past teachers include Jim Ruffaner, Bob Birch, Dan Kirsop, and Mark Clodfelter. From 2004-2006, Evan was involved in three operatic productions: Andrea Chenier, Elixir of Love, and Mefistofele. Evan continues to perform actively in both the Operatic and Music Theater worlds, including recent performances of Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story and Gilbert and Sullivan's Trial by Jury. <br /><br />In the summers of 2004, 2005, and 2008 Evan traveled on The Musical Mission Team, a combination choir and brass ensemble that toured Europe and gave nearly 100 concerts per summer. Countries that he has performed in include El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, German, Switzerland, Italy, Slovakia, Poland, Russia, and Lithuania. In addition to playing principal trumpet for this group both summers, Evan wrote several of their arrangements and transcriptions. The titles of these works are: Lyons, Ein Feste Burg, O Sacred Head Now Wounded, Like a River Glorious, and Forest Green. Some of Evan's most significant performances include participating in the inaugural performance of the International Honors Wind Symphony at Avery Fisher Hall (in May of 2009), as well as performing with the University of Kentucky Trumpet ensemble at the 2009 International Trumpet Guild conference in a concert which featured the New York Philharmonic Brass Quintet. <br /><br />Currently, Evan is a President of Foothills Philharmonic, having been with the orchestra since 2010 and has becoming a board member in 2012 (becoming President the next year). Evan has been a member of F.I.R.E. (Fountain Inn,) the Fountain Inn Symphony Orchestra, and Greenville Light Opera Works. In addition to his playing duties with the Fountain Inn Orchestra, he served on their advisory board. Other groups that he has performed with include the Greenville Heritage Textile Band and the South Carolina Children's Theater. In addition to these ensembles, Evan continues to freelance throughout the southeast performing in weddings and other social occasions. <br /><br />As a teacher, Evan teaches students of all ages throughout the South Carolina Upstate. During the spring of 2010, Evan began to transition into the role of Brass Coach for the Young Artists Orchestra in the Greenville County Youth Orchestra. In addition to his teaching and performing career, Evan also has varied research interests. In his D.M.A dissertation, he studied the impact of language on trumpet performance. In addition to being a member of the Golden Key, he also was nominated for their ISLP program. Other professional obligations include serving as the Business and Operations Manager for Ye Olde Piano Shoppe and being a member of the board for the South Carolina Public Interest Foundation. <br /><br />Evan continues to perform on the trumpet in recitals, concerts, and at other social occasions throughout the southeast.
